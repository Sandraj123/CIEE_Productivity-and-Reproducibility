## Introduction

Climate change has been of major concern globally, particularly in recent years. from 1905 to 2000, climate change has caused significant changes in Lake Mendotas [@magee]. As temperatures have warmed, ice duration has decreased over time and a trend towards earlier ice melt dates have been identified [@ghanbari2009].
